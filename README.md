DOS Shell Rollout Installer Menu
================================

DOS Shell Rollout Installer Menu is a simple menu to expediate the installation of the DOS Shell Rollout application together with its supporting services. For DOS Shell Rollout to work as it should for its network rollout, three applications need to be installed in order. These are:

- Invisible Application Starter
- DOS Shell Rollout
- DOS Shell Rollout Service

The installer menu therefore simply links to the installers of these three applications.
